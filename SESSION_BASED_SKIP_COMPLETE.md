# Profile Completion Popup - Session-Based Skip ✅

## NEW BEHAVIOR IMPLEMENTED

The 12-hour skip timer now **resets on logout/login**. The skip only works during the **SAME login session**.

---

## 🎯 Exact Logic (As Requested)

### 1. **Show Popup on Every Login** (if info is empty)
```
User logs in → Check if fields empty → Show popup
```

### 2. **Click "Skip for Now"** (during session)
```
User clicks "Skip" → Hide for 12 hours
BUT ONLY for this session!
```

### 3. **Logout and Login Again**
```
User logs out → User logs in → Show popup AGAIN
(Even if 12 hours haven't passed)
```

### 4. **Refresh During Same Session**
```
User clicks "Skip" → Refreshes page → Still hidden
(Skip still active for this session)
```

### 5. **After 12 Hours (Same Session)**
```
User keeps browser open for 12+ hours → Popup shows again
```

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Session Tracking
When user clicks "Skip for Now":
```typescript
{
  profileCompletionSkippedUntil: "2025-01-10T14:00:00Z", // 12 hours from now
  profileCompletionSkipSession: "2025-01-10T02:00:00Z"  // Current login timestamp
}
```

### Check Logic
```typescript
if (skip exists) {
  if (skipSession === currentLoginSession && skipUntil > now) {
    // ✅ Same session, within 12 hours → Don't show
    return false
  } else if (skipSession !== currentLoginSession) {
    // 🔄 New login session → Show popup again!
    return true
  } else {
    // ⏰ 12 hours passed (same session) → Show popup again!
    return true
  }
}
```

## 💾 Database Storage

### User Preferences Schema
```javascript
user.preferences = {
  profileCompleted: boolean,
  profileCompletionSkippedUntil: string,      // ISO timestamp (12 hours)
  profileCompletionSkipSession: string        // lastLoginAt when skip was created
}

user.lastLoginAt = string  // Updated on each login
```

## 🎯 Key Differences from Before

### BEFORE (Wrong)
- ❌ Skip persisted across login sessions
- ❌ User logs out and back in → Still skipped
- ❌ Skip only expired after 12 hours

### AFTER (Correct)
- ✅ Skip only works during same session
- ✅ User logs out and back in → Popup shows again!
- ✅ Skip expires after 12 hours OR new login (whichever comes first)
